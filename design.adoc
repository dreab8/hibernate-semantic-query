SQM Design Guide
================
:toc:

At a high level, SQM defines:

. access to information about the application's domain model.  SQM needs this knowledge of the domain
	model being queried in order to properly interpret the meaning (semantic) of a query
. a semantic query model that represents a query against that domain model.


== The SQM Model

=== FromClause

The FromClause defines the parts of the domain model available to the query.  A FromClause
is made up of one or more FromElementSpaces.  A FromElementSpace is defined by a "query root"
and zero-or-more "joins".

Here follows examples of the from-clause created for various queries:

.select p from Person p
====
[source]
----
SqmFromClause
	FromElementSpace
		root=SqmRoot(Person, p)
----
====

.select p from Person p, Service s
====
[source]
----
SqmFromClause
	FromElementSpace
		root=SqmRoot(Person, p)
	FromElementSpace
		root=SqmRoot(Service, s)
----
====

[NOTE]
====
It is important to note that a FromElementSpace defines a scope for the *use* of identification variables within the
FromClause (these identification variables must still be unique across the whole FromClause).  E.g., the
query `select p from Person p, Service s join p.address a` is not legal because the join to `p.address`
is defined in the second FromElementSpace but refers back to the first which is considered an illegal cross-space
reference.  This follows the SQL rule for easier understanding

=== Type system

SQM defines multiple "layers" to its type system.  The lowest level is called `SqmDomainType`.  The higher-level
concept is called `SqmExpressableType` (which is a `DomainTypeExporter` which means it exposes a `SqmDomainType`).

The `SqmDomainType` is more-or-less akin to the Java type - on the ORM side, it actually relates to the
`org.hibernate.type.spi.Type` contract.  `SqmDomainType` is further categorized into:

* `SqmDomainTypeBasic` - a basic value
* `SqmDomainTypeEmbeddable` - an embeddable/composite value
* `SqmDomainTypeEntity` - an entity value
* `SqmDomainTypeAny` - not yet implemented

A `SqmExpressableType` on the other hand represents a specific "thing" that can be the basis for the type
of an SqmExpression (see below).  `SqmExpressableType` is further categorized into:

* `SqmExpressableTypeBasic`
* `SqmNavigable`
	** SqmNavigableSource
		*** `SqmExpressableTypeEntity`
		*** `SqmExpressableTypeEmbedded`
		*** `SqmPluralAttribute`
	** `SqmAttribute`
	** `SqmEntityIdentifier`
	** `SqmPluralAttributeIndex`
	** `SqmPluralAttributeElement`
	** `SqmExpressableTypeAny` - not yet implemented

On the ORM side it is expected that `SqmExpressableType` forms the root of the JPA type system impl.

The `SqmNavigable` aspect is hugely important to understand.  It essentially equates to what JPA
calls a "Bindable".  It defines parts of the domain model that are eligible to be navigated as part of
path expressions.  A `SqmNavigable` exposes it's "source" as a `SqmNavigableSource`.  As an example, the
`SqmNavigable` for an entity attribute `Person#age` would the the "age" part and its source would be the
`EntityPersister` for Person.

A `SqmNavigableSource` is always a `SqmNavigable`.  A `SqmNavigable` may or may not be a `SqmNavigableSource` -
e.g. a `SqmPluralAttributeElement` is always a `SqmNavigable` (you can "refer to it" in a query), but it is
only a `SqmNavigableSource` when the PluralAttribute's elements are (1) an embeddable or (2) an entity.

The important concept here is that a `SqmNavigable` is a `SqmExpressableType`, meaning that the navigable itself
can be used to describe the "type" of an expression, which is important as we start to consolidate ORM-metadata
into these navigable domain descriptors on the ORM side (e.g. AttributeConverter on the SingularAttribute rather
than the Attribute's Type).


=== Expressions

Expressions (`SqmExpression`) are the basic building block of the query model - they come in many different
varieties, e.g.
* a literal
* a parameter to a reference
* a reference to a `SqmNavigable`
* an arithmetic operation
* a function call
* etc

Even a predicate is an expression!  See section on predicates below...

`SqmExpression` mainly exposes information about the "type" of the expressions in terms of the
`SqmExpressableType` discussed above.  Specifically:

* `SqmExpression#getExpressionType` - the type of this expression, if known
* `SqmExpression#getInferableType` - the type, if known, that can be used to determine
		the type of other `SqmExpression` nodes in

`#getExpressionType` returns the type of this `SqmExpression`, if known.  `#getInferableType`
returns the type, if known, that this `SqmExpression` "exports" for the purpose of determining
"related" `SqmExpression` nodes that did not explicitly define a type.  E.g., assuming a query like:

.Inferable type
====
[source]
----
select p from Person p where p.age = ?1
----
====

the predicate defines 2 `SqmExpression` nodes:

* the `SqmExpression` for the navigable `p.age`
* the `SqmExpression` for the parameter `?1`.

`?1` has no inherent type.  However, because it is involved in an equality predicate, we can look at
the "other side" of the predicate to determine an "implicit" type for the parameter node.  Specifically
we can look at the other side's `#getInferableType`.  Here, we inherently know the type of `p.age` because
`Person#age` is a mapped attribute.  So we'd expect the parameter to be of the same type.

The `SqmExpression` form of a `SqmNavigable` is called a `SqmNavigableBinding`.  The `SqmExpression` form of
a `SqmNavigableSource` is called a `SqmNavigableSourceBinding`.  Just like a `SqmNavigable` exposes its
`SqmNavigableSource`, so too a `SqmNavigableBinding` exposes its `SqmNavigableSourceBinding`.

Let's look at some example queries and how they translate into expressions, navigable and bindings...


.Expressions - Bindings and single SqmFrom
====
[source]
----
select p from Person p
----
====

As we saw above, the reference `Person p` creates a `SqmRoot` element.  `SqmFrom` elements do not themselves
implement `SqmExpression`.  However, `SqmFrom` elements may be expressed via their `SqmFrom#getBinding` returning
a `SqmNavigableBinding`.  Here specifically the `SqmRoot(Person,p)#getBinding` call returns the
`EntityBindingImpl` that represents the `SqmRoot(Person,p)#getBinding` in places where an expression is needed, such
as the reference to `p` as a selection.


.Expressions - Bindings and multiple SqmFrom
====
[source]
----
select p, pm from Person p, Person pm
----
====

Here we end up with 2 distinct `SqmFrom` elements (`SqmRoot(Person,p)` and `SqmRoot(Person,pm)`) each of which
also defines its own `EntityBindingImpl` (`SqmNavigableBining`) reference.  The selection expressions actually refer
to those `EntityBindingImpl` references.


.Expressions - type determination - arithmetic
====
[source]
----
select p.age + 10 from Person p
----
====

What is the type of the `p.age + 10` expression?  The answer is... it depends.  Specifically, it depends on
the type of `p.age`.  `10` is interpreted as a literal integer.  The type of the arithmetic expression overall
then is the resolution of the type you get when you add together (1) a value of the same type as `p.age` and
(2) a value of integer type.

This is where the `SqmExpressableType` contract mentioned above comes into play.  Both `p.age` and `10`
expose their `SqmExpressableType`:
. `p.age` - its `SqmExpressableType` would depend on the exact mapping, but let's assume the persistent
		attribute is defined as an `Integer` - which means its `SqmExpressableType` would be
		a `OrmSingularAttributeBasic` (as a `SqmExpressableTypeBasic`)
. `10` - its `SqmExpressableType` would be an ORM `BasicType<Integer>` (as an `SqmDomainTypeBasic`)

Ultimately this decision is delegated to `DomainMetamodel#resolveArithmeticType`
(`DomainMetamodel#resolveSumFunctionType` is related).


[NOTE]
====
We need to consider ways to allow customization of the `DomainMetamodel#resolveArithmeticType`
and `DomainMetamodel#resolveSumFunctionType` hooks.  This is important for custom types.  FWIW
this does not work today either with custom types.

=== Downcasts

SqmFrom elements act as a source of attribute bindings/references.  For example, given a query defining `Person` as a
root we can now refer to any of the attributes defined on `Person` and its superclasses in the query.

Sometimes we would like to refer to attributes defined on a subclass of an AttributeBindingSource.  This is where a
downcast comes into play.  HQL historically offers implicit downcasting.  JPA supports downcasting too, but in an explicit
form.

[NOTE]
====
Consider removing support for implicit downcasts?
====

Regardless of whether the downcast was implicit or explicit, the AttributeBindingSource needs to understand the set of
attributes available to be referenced.  This is defined by the
`org.hibernate.sqm.path.AttributeBindingSource.getAttributeContributingType` method.

Additionally an explicit downcast can be defined in one of two ways:

. "intrinsic downcasting" happens in the FromClause.  The downcast target is incorporated into the FromElement.  It
	becomes an "intrinsic" part of the FromElement; any references to that FromElement in any part of the query refers
	to the downcast form.  See `SqmFrom.getIntrinsicSubclassIndicator`
. "incidental downcasting" happens outside of the FromClause, as part of a path expression.  Here the downcast is
	effective just for the path expression.  See `org.hibernate.sqm.path.AttributeBindingSource.getSubclassIndicator`

All downcasts for a given FromElement are represented by the `org.hibernate.sqm.query.from.Downcastable` contract it
implements.  `Downcastable#getDowncasts` returns information about all the downcast targets for a FromElement.

====
(TREAT)

Have SqmFrom maintain a List of down-cast targets.  Ultimately we need to know whether to render these
as INNER or OUTER joins.  JPA only allows TREAT in FROM and WHERE, so SQM should consider uses in other context a
"strict JPQL violation".

An alternative to the INNER/OUTER decision is to always render an outer join here (to the subtype tables) and generate a
predicate where ever the TREAT occurs.   In the FROM clause it would become part of the join predicate.  In there WHERE
clause we'd generate a grouped predicate.  In SELECT (?) I guess just render a predicate into the WHERE.

(implicit downcasts)

Another piece to determine whether we need to include subclass tables is whether the query referenced any of the
subclass attributes.  JPQL disallows this (strict JPQL violation), but HQL allows it.

One option would be to simply handle this via the mechanism for treat.  When a subclass attribute is referenced, implicitly
add a TREAT reference to the FromElement.

Another option is to just keep a list of the referenced attributes for each FromElement.  On the "back end" we can
work out the subclass table inclusion based on that info.

== JPA criteria support

At the moment ORM builds a distinct criteria tree that it then asks SQM to parse into an SQM.  I wonder if we
can/should instead have ORM build an SQM directly from JPA criteria calls.


== not supported

* keywords used as alias.  Using `where` and `join` and `order` are especially problematic for identification variables
 	as `from` is especially problematic for result variables.  `AS` can be used to force allowance.  For example:
 	`select a.from from from Appointment a` is illegal because of the attempt to use `from` as result variable.  However,
 	`select a.from as from from Appointment a` is but legal, albeit silly. Additionally, we always check JPA strict
 	compliance and throw an exception if any reserved word is used as an identifier per spec
 	(4.4.2 Identification Variables and 4.4.1 Identifiers).  See `org.hibernate.sqm.test.hql.KeywordAsIdentifierTest`
